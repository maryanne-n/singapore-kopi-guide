# Singapore Kopi Guide
## Learn how to order coffee in Singapore like a local
Local coffee, also known as *kopi* is the go-to drink that many Singaporeans start their day with. It's made from Robusta coffee beans which are roasted with sugar and margarine under high heat. This caramelises the beans and gives it its unique somewhat "burnt" flavour. The coffee is then ground and mixed with hot water and strained in a flannel sock filter.  
Here is a visual guide to tailoring your kopi fix just how you like it - from a super strong robust flavour with no milk at all to a lighter caffeine content that comes with sweetened condensed milk.  
Enjoy! :coffee:
